# Snake

## Author: Viktoriia Morhun

## Short description
I am a student at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology and this is my programming project in Python. Snake is a popular arcade game, the player controls an object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. The snake eats apples and thus earns points and increases. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.
